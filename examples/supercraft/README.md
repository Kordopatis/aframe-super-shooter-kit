Make a WebVR shooter using only [A-Frame](http://aframe.io) and
[Supercraft](http://supermedium.com/supercraft) in one afternoon. All the
assets in the game were done using Supercraft in 45 minutes, and the code is
just 62 lines of Javascript and 133 of HTML.

Supercraft shooter uses
[aframe-super-shooter-kit](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-shooter-kit)
which provides set of simple A-Frame components for the gun, bullets, and
targets.  Then we just have to trigger and listen to events for the logic.
